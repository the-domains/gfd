Martinez, DDS</p><p> Dr. Martinez has always been interested in helping people.  Growing up he wanted to be a police officer, fire fighter, or doctor. Over time, his passion for science and medicine became stronger, cementing his will to become a doctor. Knowing he liked to work with his hands, it was clear that the dental field would be for him. </p><p>After many years of hard work and dedication to dentistry, he graduated from the University of Detroit Mercy.  Dr. Martinez was born in Guerrero, Mexico, but at the age of two, he and his mother relocated to Chicago.  He lived there with his aunts and uncles, until the start of middle school, where they decided to move to Charlotte, NC.  This was a big change for Dr. Martinez, but it was here where his passion for helping people became stronger.  At a very young age he always translated for Hispanics who had a difficult time with the English language.  Whether it was a doctor's visit, or a home visit by a nurse, there was always a need for him to translate for his mother's family and friends.   </p><p> Later on, Dr Martinez attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received his bachelors of science in Biology.  It was hard for both him and his mother to part ways while in college, but both knew the importance of education. After Chapel Hill, came a harder change for both, where he relocated to Michigan to pursue his dreams, which would ultimately help him take care of his mother and siblings.  Dr. Martinez is very family oriented, his pursuit of education and a higher degree all being for his mother. </p><p> Once he surprised his mother with the purchase of Dr. Malone's practice, she proudly said, "me siento como un pavo real, llena de orgullo," meaning she felt like a beautiful peacock, full of pride.    Finally, continuing education is very important to Dr. Martinez.  He knows that to provide the best care possible, one has to be up to date with new and emerging technologies, techniques, and materials.  He has devoted his time to learning ways to improve oral health, even learning Clear Correct (a clear alternative to braces).  He has many interests in the dental field, and he is always excited to learn more year after year, to provide excellent care for his patients.  Dr. Martinez could not be more thrilled to have his own dental practice where his many ideas can help the practice continue to grow and prosper as it did under Dr. Malone's care.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
