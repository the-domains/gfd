Sometime around the turn of the century I started using an electronic toothbrush.  I've never gone back to the manual version, and nor would I.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and my visits to the dentists are met with less agony.  Plus they're quicker and I I'd like to think they leave a smile on my hygienist's face.  But that isn't to say all electric tooth brushes are made equally.  Some are nothing more than rotating bristles propelled by an underpowered motor that probably can't be much better than the manual version, while others are excessively expensive and are merely a rebadged version of a cheaper model.
