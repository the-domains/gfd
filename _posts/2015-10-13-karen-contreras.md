Karen Contreras                                                                       

Office Administrator  I've worked at this practice as front office manager since 1999\. I can't wait to see our patients each day so that we can catch up! I consider them to be friends and enjoy hearing about their families, sharing pictures and helping them in any way that I can. I really enjoy making people happy! My husband Greg and I moved to Duncanville in 1981 from Southern California. We raised 3 children here, all of whom graduated from Duncanville High School. My 2 oldest children, Alyssa and Evan, graduated from college and have families of their own. Greg and I now have 3 grandsons, Cameron, Coy Brice and Gabe who we spend as much time with as possible. Our youngest son, Brice, attended college where he played for the soccer team. Last year he was tragically killed by a drunk driver. Our family will forever miss him. I love my job and the people I work with because we all work toward the common goal of EXCELLENCE. The quality of dentistry that Dr. Martinez demonstrates every day makes me so proud to say that I work for him at this office!   

Lori Cernosek                                                                                                                        Hygienist  I am both proud and blessed to have been a part of this extraordinary Practice for the past 26 years. I never imagined being at one office this long, now I am very excited to continue my career with Dr. Martinez.  I expect this next chapter to be as enjoyable and fulfilling as the previous years have been. I love my work, staff and patients immensely, which makes coming to the office a joy. I graduated from Baylor College of Dentistry with a Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene in 1985\. My husband, Ben, and I have been married for 28 wonderful years. We have two amazing grown children. Our oldest, Cole, lives and works in Houston in the petroleum industry. Abby, now a graduate of the University Of Texas Nursing School, works for a children's hospital in Austin. I enjoy spending time with family and friends and just about anything outdoors, especially gardening. I strive to give my patients the best possible experience through quality care and service. Our staff is committed to every patient that walks through our door. A  happy and healthy smile is   truly the best compliment I can ever receive.

Treatment Coordinator     I'm on my second "Tour of Duty" with Dr. Malone. I first worked with him in 1992, but left in 1997 to pursue my own business. In 2001, I received a phone call from Dr. Malone begging me to come back and I've been assisting him ever since! I have been blessed with four wonderful children, who continue to make me proud every day. In addition, I am "Nana" to five grandchildren, four rough and tumble boys, Kaleb, Graham, Ty and Knox and my little princess Austin. They are the light of my life! I work here because I love it! We have fun every day and I love everyone I work with. I've been a dental assistant since I was 16 years old. I can honestly say, "Dr. Malone is the very best".  Now that we have Dr. Martinez, I can honestly say that nothing has changed for me.  I still love coming to work and doing what I do.  I look forward to retiring with Dr. Martinez in 40 years.

After I graduated from Sunset High School in 2002, I went from job to job trying to find a field. Then in 2004, I was hired at my first dental office. My job was to make sure all instruments and rooms were clean. A few months in, I was trusted to work on my very first patient. I never wanted to stop learning after that.  I live here in Duncanville with my fiance Kristine, and my beautiful newborn son Sonny James. Watch out for him, he may be a Dallas Maverick or Cowboy soon!  Kris and I are concert junkies and watch and listen to all types of music. Her open mind for music is one of the many things that made me fall in love with her. Even though she hates seeing me with short hair, she understands that it's donated to kids with cancer.  I hope our son has the same open mind and care for others as his parents. I'm glad to have found such a wonderful office full of great caring people to work with. I know that working with a doctor as dedicated as Dr. Martinez will only make me a better assistant. I appreciate all the extra time he takes to answer the questions I have, and his subtle reminders of his gratitude for the hard work we all put in at the office. Our goal will always be to make  sure our patients have the most pleasant experience.
